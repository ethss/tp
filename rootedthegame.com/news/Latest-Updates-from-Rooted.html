                            <p class="card-text"><p>Fellow Survivors!</p><p>The past week has been an absolute whirlwind for us, especially after unveiling the first few videos introducing one of Rooted's characters. Here, we are offering a deeper insight into our game.</p><h2>ROOTED, a Post-Apocalyptic Survival Adventure</h2><p>There's just something about the post-apocalyptic genre that captivates us—it evokes profound emotions and uniquely thrilling gaming experiences. Hence, we couldn't envision any other setting for Rooted. Titles like The Last of Us, Scum, DayZ, and more serve as our primary sources of inspiration. Rooted incorporates classic survival game mechanics, but also introduces innovative movements and management techniques that evolve as you progress in the game. We sincerely hope you'll love it!</p><h2>Engage in Single-Player or Multiplayer Modes</h2><p>In Rooted, you can play both single-player and multiplayer modes. Your friends can join and progress alongside you. You can share your camp and resources, explore together, and make use of the game mechanics created by your allies. Our aim is to provide you with a fulfilling experience in both modes.</p><h2>Current State of Game Development</h2><p>At present, our primary focus is on fine-tuning the gameplay mechanics. We've decided to share some sneak-peeks featuring our game's unique features within a post-apocalyptic context. This should help you better visualize the final gameplay experience.</p><p>At this initial phase, our emphasis is on the '3Cs'—characters, controls, and camera. Our goal is to make controlling the characters and navigating the open world enjoyable for players! Harnessing Unreal Engine 5's technologies provides us with a robust starting point for incorporating our ideas and mechanics. Simply put, it helps us create the gaming experience we've envisioned.</p><p>We've incorporated backpack physics that emphasize interaction with the backpack, allowing you to attach inventory items like tools, weapons, and other found items for customizing your bag! Customization is central to our game.</p><p>We've also incorporated a day-night cycle. One of our videos showcases real-time rendering, which is genuinely stunning. The lighting, the nightfall, the transitions—all are elements we adore, and we hope you will, too. As we work on the character constants, influenced by various factors like altitude, weather, etc., we have shared a quick weather transition video to spotlight the minute details we care about—for instance, the character crossing his arms when he's cold. Our goal is to foster immersion.</p><h2>Keep Up With Us on Social Media</h2><p>https://linktr.ee/rootedthegame</p><h2>Rooted for PC and Consoles?</h2><p>At this phase of development, our concentration is on the PC version of the game, which you can add to your wishlist right now. We are eager to eventually expand the Rooted experience to consoles, but we will revisit this idea much later in our development timeline.</p><h2>How to Support Rooted</h2><p>If you wish to support Rooted, we have a simple request: tell your friends about the game and add it to your wishlist! We deeply appreciate your support! We'll continue sharing our progress and the joy we experience while creating it. A huge thank you to all the players who appreciate our project and support us. We're excited for you to play our game! See you soon!</p></p>
